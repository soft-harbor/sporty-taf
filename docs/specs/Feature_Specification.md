# Feature Specification - Single Bet Placement

## 1. Feature Overview

Users can place a single bet on a sports event outcome. This is the core betting
functionality that allows customers to wager money on match results with odds.

- **Platform:** Desktop web application
- **Sport:** Soccer/Football only
- **Event Type:** Upcoming/Pre-match events only (no live betting)
- **Bet Type:** Single bet only (no accumulator/multi-bets)

**Out of scope:**

- Live betting
- Multi-bets/accumulators
- Other sports
- Mobile-specific UX requirements

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Match List

Display upcoming football matches. Each match shows:

- home team vs away team
- kickoff date/time label
- three selectable odds buttons: `1`, `X`, `2`

Behavior:

- User clicks on odds to select an outcome for betting.
- Selecting a new odds button replaces the previous selection.

### 2.2 Bet Slip

- Right-side fixed bet slip.
- Shows one active selection at a time.
- Shows entered stake, available balance, and computed potential payout.
- Includes:
  - Place Bet
  - Remove All
  - per-selection remove (x)

### 2.3 Place Bet Interaction

- On submit, the button enters a loading state (`Placing...`).
- After submit, the UI must show an in-progress state and resolve to one final
  outcome (success or failure).
- **On success:**
  - stake is deducted
  - success receipt modal appears
- **On failure:**
  - error modal appears with retry option

### 2.4 Success Receipt

Receipt must show:

- Bet ID
- Match details
- Selection
- Stake
- Odds at placement
- Potential payout
- Placement timestamp

Closing the receipt returns the user to the main flow without an active selection.

### 2.5 Error Modal

- **Modal title:** Something went wrong.
- **Modal body:** explains that the bet could not be processed and suggests trying again.
- **Actions:**
  - **Rebet (primary):** on click it closes the modal and retries placement.
  - **Close (secondary):** closes modal and clears current selection/stake.
  - **top-right X:** same behavior as Close.

### 2.6 Filters

- Date filter supports single day or date range (inclusive).
- Odds filter supports min/max range (inclusive) and must reject invalid ranges
  with clear feedback.
